# 3-Bit Password Checker
This circuit simulates a basic password-activated lock system using digital logic gates. It uses a NOT gate to invert the B input and a 3-input AND gate to evaluate the condition A = 1, B = 0, and C = 1. The “Unlocked” output only goes high when the exact binary input 101 is entered.
